## Installation:
Installing GemAI is simple. For global access, execute one of the commands below:

* **Using Node Package Manager (NPM):**
```bash
npm install -g gemai
```

* **or if you are using (PNPM):**
```bash
pnpm install -g gemai
```

## Usage:
### Logging In:
Before using GemAI, you'll need to log in with your Google Gemini API token. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
gemai login [token]
```

**Example:**
```bash
gemai login Flqw9TUeaSkRfRii3lmgZLid
```

This command sends a request to the Gemini endpoint for authentication. Upon receiving a successful response, your API key will be verified. 

If you encounter any issues, try running `gemai login <token>` again to refresh your credentials.

### Viewing Configuration:
To view your current GemAI configuration, simply type:

```bash
gemai config
```

This will display the contents of the `gemai.json` file stored on your machine.

### Updating Configuration:

To update the default values of GemAI, run this command:

```bash
gemai config set
```

By default, when you log in, we have set some default values that are required for the Google Gemini API to work properly, such as:

- `maxOutputTokens`: 2048
- `topK`: 40
- `topP`: 1
- `temperature`: 0.7

To update these default values, simply run `gemai config set`. After running this command, you will be prompted to enter your desired values in place of the default values.

### Engaging in a Chat:
Ready to start chatting with the GemAI chatbot? Run the following command:

```bash

Once authenticated, you can dive right into a conversation with the chatbot.
